It is John Gamejam's first day on the job at WCGW Co's flagship reactor. He doesn't have a clue how to operate it but LUCKILY his boss is going to tell him. 

Surely nothing bad will happen.

Surely.


[Game made for <a href="https://bobjohnson.itch.io/watt-could-go-wrong">Brackeys 2025 Game Jam!</a> We had a great time making this as our first ever Game Jam, even if it is a bit rough around the edges, we hope you enjoy nonetheless!]


INSTRUCTIONS: You control John Gamejam as he attempts to avoid the imminentmeltdown of the reactor core he has been tasked with overseeing. You must complete mini puzzles to stem the progress into oblivion - you'll have to figure out how these work yourself though! However, if all seems lost, head to the bunker and swipe your access card to avoid dying in a cataclysmic explosion. 

You can find the game on <a href="https://bobjohnson.itch.io/watt-could-go-wrong">itch.io</a>, or build from the source code in this repo (unity version 2022.3.51f1), then WASD to move, SHIFT to sprint, E to interact! Have fun, nothing can possibly go wrong!
